# readme-writer

You need to either write a new README.md from scratch or rewrite an existing README.md so that it looks like a real GITHUB developer README and not a neuro slob generated by artificial intelligence AI.

Here is the list of things **NOT** to do (signs of AI-generated content):

1. Using emojis.
2. Writing pompous intros with adjectives like "revolutionary," "powerful," "innovative," or "game-changing."
3. Including phrases like "Created with [ChatGPT/Claude/etc.]."
4. Adding sterile/fake badges (100% coverage, build passing) on an empty or small project.
5. Using vague buzzwords like "Built on cutting-edge 2025/2026 technologies" without specifics.
6. Creating redundant sections (e.g., having "Features," "Capabilities," and "Functionality" as separate lists).
7. Making unrealistic promises like "Installs in seconds" or "Instant launch."
8. Including huge ASCII art logos or banners at the top.
9. Listing an overambitious roadmap (Web3, AI, Blockchain) with zero code to back it up.
10. Inviting people to "Join our rapidly growing community" when the project has 0 stars.
11. Using a marketing landing page tone instead of technical documentation.
12. Including broken or fake links to demos, articles, or screenshots.
13. Claiming "Production ready" or "100% test coverage" when the test folder is empty.
14. Writing text that is too smooth and soulless, lacking any human "roughness" or personality.
